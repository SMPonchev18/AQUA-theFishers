                <p class = "text">Warm water holds less dissolved oxygen than cold water, so summer is the time when fish can have a hard time getting enough oxygen. Other organisms use oxygen, too, including the algae that grow in the summer and bacteria that degrade organic matter. During the day, the algae produce oxygen through photosynthesis, but at night, when photosynthesis stops, they and other organisms keep respiring, using up oxygen.</p>

                <p class = "title2">What causes fish kills?</p>

                <p class = "text2">Fish kills also can occur as a result to toxic compounds released into a body of water. In order for this to occur, the toxic compound must be fairly highly concentrated. In a large water body this would require a very large amount of the toxic compound, and a release site fairly close to the affected fish.
                    Fish not only transport nutrients in their bodies, as described above, but they are also important food sources for a wide variety of animals on land and air. These animals include bears, birds, seals, as well as humans.</p>

                <p class = "title">How Do Fish Help the Environment?</p>

                <p class = "text">Schools of fish are known to aid in the regulation of carbon flux between the atmosphere and the bodies of water. Carbon flux refers to the amount of carbon exchanged between the carbon pools on Earth, such as the atmosphere, bodies of water, land, as well as living organisms.
                    Fish have an indirect role in the mediation of carbon flux, but it is an unwelcome role. In a nutrient-rich lake, for example, it becomes a carbon sink that removes and stores carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.</p>

                <p class = "text">Dispose of trash properly. This will help reduce the amount of trash blown into the waterways or washed from storm drains into the sea. Light objects such as plastic bags can easily blow away. Never let it lay around outside. In the central North Pacific, researchers have found six pounds of broken, degraded plastic pieces plastic for every single pound of zooplankton. Plastic pollution negatively impacts trillions upon trillions of ocean inhabitants and ultimately humans.</p>

                <p class = "text2">Do not dispose any fluids (paint, lawn debris, car fluids, trash) except for clean water down storm drains or roadways as it may end up in water courses and eventually in the sea. Also, maintain your car so that no oil and other fluids leak out. Use kitty litter and diapers to catch the fluids if you do have a leak.</p>
